1. Waterfall Model
Advantages:
- Clarity and Structure: Clear, sequential phases make it ideal for stable, well-defined requirements.
- Documentation Emphasis: Extensive documentation aids traceability and maintenance, crucial for regulatory compliance.

Disadvantages:
- Limited Flexibility: Hard to make changes after a phase is completed.
- Late Issue Discovery: Problems often surface late, leading to costly rework.

Applicability:
- Infrastructure Projects: Bridges, roads, buildings.
- Manufacturing Processes: Design and implementation.

2. Agile Model
Advantages:
- Flexibility and Adaptability: Iterative approach suits evolving requirements.
- Customer Collaboration: Regular feedback ensures the product meets user needs.

Disadvantages:
- Documentation Challenges: Less focus on documentation, problematic for compliance-heavy projects.
- Resource Intensive: High collaboration demands more resources.

Applicability:
- Software Development: Control systems, embedded systems.
- Prototyping and R&D: Iterative development and experimentation.

 3. Spiral Model
Advantages:
- Risk Management: Continuous risk analysis and mitigation.
- Iterative Development: Allows refinement of complex designs.

Disadvantages:
- Complexity and Expertise: Needs experienced management and technical skills.
- Time and Resource Intensive: Longer cycles and more resources needed.

Applicability:
- Aerospace and Defense: High complexity, long cycles, stringent risk management.
- Medical Devices: Safety, reliability, and regulatory compliance.

 4. V-Model
Advantages:
- Testing Emphasis: Early detection of defects through continuous testing.
- Clear Verification and Validation: Defined milestones and quality checks.

Disadvantages:
- Sequential Nature: Hard to implement changes later.
- Documentation Overhead: Extensive upfront planning and documentation.

Applicability:
- Regulated Industries: Healthcare, automotive, aerospace with rigorous testing and compliance needs.
