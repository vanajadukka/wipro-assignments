1. Requirements Gathering:
Identify stakeholders' needs and define project scope.
Gather and analyze requirements to ensure they are clear, complete, and feasible.
·  Importance: Establishes the foundation of the project by understanding stakeholders' needs.
·  Interconnection: Informs subsequent phases, guiding design and development efforts
2. Defining:
Develop a comprehensive project plan outlining tasks, resources, timelines, and budgets.
Define project goals, milestones, and deliverables.
·  Importance: Sets the roadmap for the project, ensuring alignment with goals and resources.
·  Interconnection: Directs the design and development process, shaping the project   trajectory.
3. Design:
Create a detailed design of the software system based on gathered requirements.
Design architecture, user interface, database schema, and other system components.
·  Importance: Translates requirements into a blueprint for the software solution.
·  Interconnection: Guides implementation by providing a detailed framework for development.
4. Implementation (Coding):
Write code according to the design specifications.
Conduct unit testing to ensure individual components work as expected.
·  Importance: Converts design specifications into working software.
·  Interconnection: Built upon requirements and design, forming the tangible product.




5. Testing:
Execute various tests (unit, integration, system, acceptance) to identify defects and verify software functionality.
Ensure the software meets quality standards and requirements.
·  Importance: Validates software functionality and identifies defects.
·  Interconnection: Feedback loop with design and implementation to refine and improve the product.
6. Deployment:
Release the software to the production environment.
Install, configure, and deploy the system to end-users.
·  Importance: Introduces the software to users in the production environment.
·  Interconnection: Culmination of previous phases, ensuring readiness for real-world use.
7. Maintenance:
Provide ongoing support, maintenance, and updates to the software.
Address user feedback, fix bugs, and implement enhancements.
·  Importance: Sustains the software's functionality and addresses evolving needs.
·  Interconnection: Continuous improvement loop, integrating user feedback and addressing issues.
